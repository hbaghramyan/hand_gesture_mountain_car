# Controll MountainCar-v0 Gym Environment with hand gestures

### Usage

Run both scripts at the same time. When `gesture-controll.py` starts
recognizing your hand you can now run `mountain-car-play.py`. The game window
will now be displayed. Click on the window and then start moving your index
finger to left or right.
